Simplicity-MYR - V0.3.2
==============

Minimal clicking multiple Myriadcoin algorithm miner 

This miner is supposed to be as simple as possible and it mines directly to an electrum wallet that is set up during initial run.

To start using run the RunMe.vbs file. 

On your desktop you should also see a Electrum-MyrWallet.exe file after you run the script the first time.

That is where your mined myriadcoin will be deposited.
